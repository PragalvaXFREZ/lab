# Homelab

This repository documents the work I do in my homelab. The goal is to create a controlled environment where I can experiment with Linux, networking, automation, and Kubernetes concepts in a practical way. I use this space to test ideas, improve my infrastructure skills, and build a deeper understanding of how systems behave beyond theory.

## Why I Maintain a Homelab

A homelab allows me to replicate real infrastructure scenarios without depending on cloud resources. It helps me explore configuration management, observe system behaviour, and learn through trial and error. Every setup or experiment I run here directly strengthens my technical decision making.

## What This Repository Contains

This repo includes:
- Configuration files and small experiments
- Kubernetes practice manifests
- Notes from troubleshooting or learning sessions
- Any reproducible setup steps that I want to track or refine
----
More improvements will be added as the homelab grows.
