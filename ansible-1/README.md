# Ansible Learning & Practice Repository

This repository documents my learning journey and hands-on practice with Ansible for infrastructure automation and configuration management.  
It serves as a portfolio to demonstrate familiarity with common automation workflows, playbook design, role-based structure, and environment provisioning.

## Motivation & Purpose

As part of experimenting within my homelab environment, I used this project to: 
- Understand secure SSH-based orchestration and host connectivity.  
- Practice writing repeatable, reliable Ansible playbooks.  
- Build modular automation with roles, inventory management, host variables, templating, and service management.  
- Learn how to bootstrap new servers, manage users, files, and services via code rather than manual configuration.  

## Key Concepts & Skills Demonstrated

Through hands on experimentation in my homelab, this project helped me to learn about:

- SSH setup and secure host access  
- Running ad hoc commands for quick tasks  
- Writing and optimizing playbooks  
- Targeting specific hosts or groups via inventory  
- Use of tags to control playbook execution  
- File management: copying, templating, editing configuration files  
- Service management: installing, enabling, starting, stopping services  
- User management and server bootstrap tasks  
- Role-based design for modular and reusable automation  
- Host variables and handlers for environment-specific configuration
