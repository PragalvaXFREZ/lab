# Lab Experiments

This repository documents hands on experiments from my homelab.
It serves as a place to explore systems, tooling, and infrastructure concepts through direct practice rather than polished production setups.

The focus is on learning by doing, breaking things, and understanding how different components behave in real environments.
As my homelab evolves, new experiments and areas will be added here.
